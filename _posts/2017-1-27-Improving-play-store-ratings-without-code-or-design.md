There are times that feels like even if you are working in a team with the best developers and designers out there, your users still don't get it. Not many people rate your app and those who do, do not seem to be that positive, even if there is no breaking issue in the app.

In my talk 'Improving Play Store ratings without code or design' for the December's 2016 [Athens Android Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/Athens-Android-Developers-Group/events/235752409/) meetup you can find ways of getting a better understanding of your user base, with the tools you already have.

You can find the talk here (in Greek):
