Interested in Machine Learning from a design point of view? I will be giving a talk in Design Lab London on Wednesday, September 20, 2017. See you there!

**Abstract**
Machine learning is the new cool buzz word of the computer industry. You hear it being thrown to most new and existing products by the big companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook, promising amazing new features and capabilities which were not feasible before without it. The explanation of what Machine Learning is often gets rather technical. Models, training, layers and so many other things. What do designers need out of all this?
In this talk, Alex will go through a human explanation of what Machine Learning is, leaving all the technical bits out. We are going to go through some everyday use cases and examples on existing products and see how we can get you started into designing with Machine Learning in mind.
