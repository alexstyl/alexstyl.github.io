Let's have a chat about platform-agnostic code. I'll be giving a talk for the **GDG Android Athens** meetup in **The Cube** on **Wednesday, October 11, 2017**.

### Abstract

Sharing the same codebase across different platforms is the number one dream to many developers. With Kotlin being the new official language for Android and it being already used on other platforms such as the web (and eventually iOS), it is the perfect time to talk about sharing code across platforms.

In this talk Alex will go through the steps he is following to achieve the cross-platform dream in his side project, Memento Calendar, from start to end of a feature. We are going to see how to structure your project so that your business logic is separated from platform specific code, how to write platform agnostic features and how to test them.
