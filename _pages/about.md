Alex Styl (short for Alexandros Stylianidis) is a Software Engineer in [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) London and one of the people behind the [GDG Android Athens](http://www.gdgandroidathens.com) community. Alex has a strong technical background in Computer Science as well as design having both academic and industrial experience.

I have a great interest in human-computer interactions and how we can create interactions that enhance our everyday lives. In 2014, I studied how people use technology and researched new ways of improving it in the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), where I graduated with a MSc in Human-Computer Interactions. My final project was focused on ubiquitous computing and cross-device interactions, which was later published and presented in [CHI2017's Late-Breaking Work](http://alexstyl.com/SenseBelt-A-Belt-Worn-Sensor-to-Support-Cross-Device-Interaction/).

I am an active member of the Android community, contributing with blogposts, conferences and meet-ups worldwide. You can find my talks on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/alexstyl/). I am involved in the organisation of [DesignLab London](https://www.meetup.com/DesignLabLondon/). It's our monthly design meetup with design talks of different fields of digital design.

Hobbies include sketching and photography and sometimes tinkering.
