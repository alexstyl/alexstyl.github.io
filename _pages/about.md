Alex Styl (short for Alexandros Stylianidis) is a Software Craftsman based in London, UK. Currently, a proud member of the awesome [Novoda](https://www.novoda.com) team.

I have a great interest in human-computer interactions and how we can create interactions that enhance our everyday lives. In 2014, I studied how people use technology and researched new ways of improving it in the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), where I graduated with a MSc in Human-Computer Interactions.

I am an active member of the Android community, contributing to conferences and meet-ups worldwide. You can find my talks on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/alexstyl/). Other than attending Android conferences, I am also one of the administrators of the [Greek Android Development Slack team](https://androiddevs-gr.github.io).

Hobbies include sketching and photography and sometimes tinkering.
