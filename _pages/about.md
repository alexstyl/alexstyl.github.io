Alex Styl (short for Alexandros Stylianidis) is a Software Engineer based in London. Alex has a strong technical background in Computer Science as well as design having both academic and industrial experience.

I have a great interest in human-computer interactions and how we can create interactions that enhance our everyday lives. In 2014 I studied how people use technology and researched new ways of improving it in the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), where I graduated with a MSc in Human-Computer Interactions. My final project was focused on ubiquitous computing and cross-device interactions, which was later published and presented in [CHI2017's Late-Breaking Work](http://alexstyl.com/SenseBelt-A-Belt-Worn-Sensor-to-Support-Cross-Device-Interaction/).

This website works as a central point where you can find all my work and steps. Feel free to explore as you please and do not hesitate to reach out.
