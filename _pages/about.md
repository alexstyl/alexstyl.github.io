Alex Styl (short for Alexandros Stylianidis) is a Product Designer based in London, UK. Currently, a proud member of the awesome [Novoda](https://www.novoda.com) team.

I have a great interest in human-computer interactions and how we can create interactions that enhance our everyday lives. In 2014, I studied how people use technology and researched new ways of improving it in the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx), where I graduated with a MSc in Human-Computer Interactions. My final project was focused on ubiquitous computing and cross-device interactions, which was later published and presented in [CHI2017's Late-Breaking Work](http://alexstyl.com/SenseBelt-A-Belt-Worn-Sensor-to-Support-Cross-Device-Interaction/).

I am an active member of the Android community, contributing with blogposts, conferences and meet-ups worldwide. You can find my talks on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/alexstyl/). Other than attending Android conferences, I am also involved in the [GDG Android Athens](http://www.gdgandroidathens.com). Once per month you can find me hosting [DesignLab](https://www.meetup.com/DesignLabLondon/) over Google Campus in London. It's our monthly design meetup with design talks of different fields of digital design.

Hobbies include sketching and photography and sometimes tinkering.
